## Todo

* [X] A free 3D camera
* [X] Water particles simulation
* [X] Basic visual effect: skybox, lighting, texture
* [ ] Connect particles into a surface

## Building Requirement

CUDA, gcc, glfw3, GLEW, CMake

| D                | Press/Hold                                          | Move the camera right a certain distance/continuously     |
| Space            | Press/Hold                                          | Move the camera up a certain distance/continuously        |
| Ctrl             | Press/Hold                                          | Move the camera down a certain distance/continuously      |
| Shift            | Hold                                                | Increase camera moving speed, release to return to normal |
| X                | Press                                               | Switch simulation status to running                       |
| P                | Press                                               | Toggle simulation status between pause and running        |
| R                | Press                                               | Initialize SPH particle data, and pause simulation        |

This project is based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation computational method from [CPP-Fluid-Particles](https://github.com/zhai-xiao/CPP-Fluid-Particles). I extend gratitude to [zhai-xiao](https://github.com/zhai-xiao) for their foundational work that enables our project to implement.
